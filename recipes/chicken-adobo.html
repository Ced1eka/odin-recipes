    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      My Filipino Mom taught me how to make this traditional dish following the
      recipe her mother taught her. And though I've made a couple of changes, I
      guarantee they're Mom-approved. 'Lolah' is 'Grandma' in the Philippines,
      in case you were wondering. Serve over steamed rice.
